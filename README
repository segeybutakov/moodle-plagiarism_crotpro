IMPLEMENTATION
1. Login as a teacher to Moodle.
2. Go to the course, then to the assignment that you want to be processed by the antiplagiarism plugin. At the moment Crotpro works with the following types of assignments:
	- Advanced uploading of files
3. Click Assignment administration/Edit settings link.
4. In the Crotpro block enable CrotPro checkups.
5. Save settings and wait for the cron scheduler to process the assignments submit the files for the checkup and receive results.
   IMPORTANT: setting cron on Moodle is covered in Moodle doc: http://docs.moodle.org/20/en/Cron
	EVEN MORE IMPORTANT: It would be better to setup cron running php command from the command prompt, NOT using wget command as it may cause cron timeout.
   If you are not sure how cron works on your server please ask your system administrator about it.
   Please note that processing may take significant time. 
    When you run cron first time it sends the files for the checkup. When you run cron second time it checks with Croppro server if the results are ready. 
    Please allow up to the 24 hours for the Crot Pro BETA to deliver you the results. 
6. Go to the assignment, click "View submitted assignments" link and you will see the maximum similarity score for submitted files.
7. Open the link with similarity score and compare documents.
